# hello-world
I don't know what I'm doing.
My name is Dannah and I like long walks on the beach. I actually don't live anywhere near a beach, unless you allow for beaches on a lake. Let's just assume that I don't go for long walks on any type of beach often. In all reality, I'm just a person seeing what this "coding" thing is all about. It's been nice to meet you (introduce myself).
